When co-designing this tournament page, there were two intentions behind the design and placement. Firstly, it is to drive people to want to be able to sign up. This is primarily done by having an enticing design, as well as showcasing our key selling points, but also by making the action button (the "signup" button) the most distinct button on the whole page. The other objective of this page is to make the information as easily digestible as possible, mainly since there is a lot of information. This is done by breaking the information down into four segments. The first is the key information everyone needs to know - the dates. This is what is displayed first and foremost. The three other segments (key selling points, expanded information, and technical information) all require action from the user before going to that information, which makes it easier for them to digest at once, and by requiring that action, it mentally prepares the user for the new information.                </div><br>
