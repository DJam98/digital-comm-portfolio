                        While this is quite a minimalistic storyboard, it is intentionally designed to be that way. What often catches people's attention - particularly regarding social media content, is straightforward, digestible content. So, the thought process behind the post is to build on two events that have made it onto trending topics on social media. The first is the floods in Tokyo, where the floodwater that infiltrated the train stations is clear. Compare this to how murky and polluted France's waters are, even when the Olympic games are occurring. Putting these two posts side by side is to motivate primarily the public to be more aware when littering, but also for governments to start stepping up.                    </p>
