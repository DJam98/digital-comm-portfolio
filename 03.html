                When it comes to presenting myself online, I generally stick to the brand that I'm trying to portray on that platform and account. For me personally, that is split up into three personas: my public "personality" account (@DJam98 / @DJam987), my professional design account (@JDawsonDesign), and my own private account (@moshi198). 
<br><br>
My personality account is my most active account, as it's where I get the most impressions and views, but it's also any form of platform where people come to me as who I present myself on the internet. In this context, is as a streamer, commentator and tournament organiser. The platforms associated with this are Twitter/X, Twitch, YouTube, and Discord (within public servers). All of my posts and content on these platforms are shaped to elevate either myself or any brand/organisation I'm supporting. 
<br><br>
The most simple one is my professional accounts, living purely on Instagram and LinkedIn. These accounts exist to showcase my design talents and get work. For this to seem appealing to clients, it is intentionally barebones to only provide it with a personality other than the featured content.
<br><br>
Finally, there is my private account. This is just for talking to people I know in the real world. Having a separate username prevents bad actors on the internet from discovering my real identity. It helps me distinguish what is for the public versus just for my friends.
<br><br>
However, across all these platforms, there is still one thing that will always be a uniting factor. It is a core part of my online branding. And that is the "authentic." I want people to find me as someone who isn't necessarily bound to do whatever is the "norm" or what would gain me the most views (because there are undoubtedly many ways I could change my branding to get me a lot more views and attention).
<br><br>
I want people to see me for who I am. That is the foundation of my online persona.
