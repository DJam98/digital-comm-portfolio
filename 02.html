                        The thought process behind this mood board is to show how communication technology has evolved over the passage of time. Something I wanted to capture with this mood board, however, wasn't just the simple evolution of communication technology but also the paths that it has split up. Traditionally, communication technology was purely reliant on physical, printed words. But as time has continued, rather than saying that printing has evolved to digital, it's more like they've split into two directions: physical and digital. Hence, that has led me to create the two different evolution paths.                    </p>
