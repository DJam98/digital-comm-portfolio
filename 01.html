                Hi there! I’m James, a student at the School of Design pursuing a Bachelor of Design in Digital Media. What is the best way to describe me? Hmm… that’s a good question in itself.
                <br><br>
                Let’s get the obvious out of the way… I am human.
                <br><br>
                But other than that, my design focus mainly specialises in graphic and web design, and I also dabble a bit in video and sound design.
                <br><br>
                Beyond design, however, I also provide online commentary for video games (mainly Splatoon 3) and stream on my personal Twitch channel.
                <br><br>
                If you want to know more about me (I don’t know why you would want to), you can visit my portfolio by clicking the button below (jdawson.au).
